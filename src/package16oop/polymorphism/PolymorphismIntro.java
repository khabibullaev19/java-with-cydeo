        -> Occurs when reference type is parent class/interface and object type is child.

        -> Only the variables/methods in the reference type can be called.
        -> When we call a method, it will call overridden version from a child class.
        -> If the method is not overridden, it will call the parent/super class version.

        -> Reference type can be parent class of interface.
        -> Object type can be any extending or implementing child class.
        -> Reference type decides what is accessible.
