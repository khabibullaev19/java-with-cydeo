        -> An unwanted or unexpected event.
        -> Occurs during the compile time or during the runtime.
        -> There are two categories of exceptions:
                    => Checked Exceptions
                    => Unchecked Exceptions

             Unchecked Exceptions:
           - Exceptions that are not checked at compile time.
           - Occurs during the runtime.
           - Code will compile even if we do not handle them.
           - They have IS-A relationship with RuntimeException (parent) class.

             Checked Exception:
           - Exceptions that are checked at compile time.
           - Occurs during the compile time.
           - Code will not compile if we do not handle them immediately.
           - They do not have IS-A relationship with RuntimeException class.

             Errors:
           - Indicates that an illegal operation is being performed.
           - Occurs during the runtime only.
           - They can not be recovered, and not recommended to handle them.
