        - Parent interface of Collection Interface.
        - Allows the object to be Iterated by using Iterator.
        - Iterator is used when we want to remove elements whilst you
          iterate over a collection.

          How to use Iterator?
        - We can obtain the Iterator by using the iterator() method of an Iterable.
        - The Iterator interface provides the ready methods that can be used while
          traversing the collections:
                                     -> hasNext()
                                     -> next()
                                     -> remove()

     */

}
